Power BI Project: Super Store Sales Dashboard

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize sales data for a super store. The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Project Objectives

1. Develop a Power BI Dashboard: Create a dashboard showing sales trends, top products, and regional performance using sample data.
2. Combine Data from Multiple Sources: Integrate data from at least two different sources (e.g., Excel and SQL Server) to create a unified report.
3. Set up a Real-Time Dashboard: Create a live Power BI dashboard that updates in real-time using streaming data (e.g., from Azure or a simulated API feed).
4. Use Python or R Scripts: Perform advanced data analysis or visualizations using Python or R scripts within Power BI.

Deliverables

- A Power BI file (.pbix) with interactive visuals and slicers
- A Power BI report demonstrating data integration and visualizations
- A live Power BI dashboard that updates in real-time
- A Power BI report showcasing the use of Python or R scripts

Steps to Develop the Dashboard

Step 1: Develop a Power BI Dashboard
1. Import sample sales data into Power BI.
2. Create visualizations to show sales trends, top products, and regional performance.
3. Add interactive slicers to filter data by date, product, and region.

Step 2: Combine Data from Multiple Sources
1. Connect to Excel and SQL Server data sources.
2. Import data from both sources into Power BI.
3. Create a unified report that combines data from both sources.

Step 3: Set up a Real-Time Dashboard
1. Set up a streaming data source (e.g., Azure or a simulated API feed).
2. Create a Power BI dashboard that updates in real-time.
3. Add visualizations to show real-time data.

Step 4: Use Python or R Scripts
1. Import Python or R libraries into Power BI.
2. Write scripts to perform advanced data analysis or visualizations.
3. Add visualizations to show results of script execution.

Technical Requirements

- Power BI Desktop
- Sample sales data dataset (included in the repository)
- Excel and SQL Server data sources
- Streaming data source (e.g., Azure or a simulated API feed)
- Python or R libraries

How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Power BI file (.pbix) in Power BI Desktop.
3. Refresh the data by clicking on the "Refresh" button in the Home tab.
4. Explore the dashboard and interact with the visualizations.

Data Model

The data model consists of the following tables:

- Sales: Sales data, including date, product, customer, and sales amount
- Products: Product information, including product name, category, and price
- Customers: Customer information, including customer name, demographics, and purchase history

Calculations

The dashboard includes several calculated measures, including:

- Total Sales: Sum of sales amount
- Revenue: Sales amount minus discounts
- Profit Margin: (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue

Future Enhancements

- Add more visualizations, such as maps and treemaps
- Integrate with other data sources, such as customer feedback and social media data
- Use advanced analytics, such as predictive modeling and clustering
